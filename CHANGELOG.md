## 7.0.0

8TLR version 7 marks the initial release of an entirely new router application.

It replaces [Eight Track LR Router version 6](https://github.com/zapperment/8tlr-router-desktop), which is now obsolete.

This new router communicates with Eight Track LR Max for Live devices through UDP messages instead of MIDI.

Built with [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max). Previous versions were built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).
